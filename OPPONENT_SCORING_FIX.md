# ðŸŽ¯ Opponent Scoring Fixed - Realistic Competition!

## âœ… **FIXED ISSUES**

### **1. Realistic Opponent Scoring**
- **Before**: Opponent automatically got correct answers and scores
- **After**: Opponent has to actually "answer" questions to earn points
- **Realism**: 70% accuracy rate (realistic for a human opponent)
- **Wrong Answers**: Opponent gets close but not exact answers when wrong (1-3 off)
- **Timing**: Opponent answers between 1-4 seconds (realistic response time)

### **2. Black Text While Typing**
- **Before**: Text color could be unclear while typing
- **After**: Always black text while typing for perfect readability
- **Visual States**:
  - âœ… **Black text** while typing normally
  - âœ… **Green text** when answer is correct
  - âœ… **Red text** when answer is wrong

### **3. Preserved All Features**
- âœ… **Real-time score display** still works perfectly
- âœ… **Automatic answer checking** still works
- âœ… **Green/red visual feedback** still works
- âœ… **Auto-submit for correct answers** still works
- âœ… **Seamless typing experience** still works
- âœ… **Live progress tracking** still works

## ðŸŽ® **How It Works Now**

### **Opponent Experience (Simulated):**

2. **70% chance of getting it right** (realistic accuracy)
3. **Wrong answers are close** but not exact (1-3 off)

5. **You see opponent's progress** in real-time
