# 🎮 Test URL Join Functionality

## 🚀 **Fixed: URL Join Now Works Properly**

I've fixed the URL join functionality. Here's how to test it:

### **Step 1: Create a Lobby**
1. **Open Browser 1** to `http://localhost:3000`
2. **Click "Demo Mode"**
3. **Click "Create New Lobby"**
4. **Copy the lobby ID** (e.g., `ihaqhfsio`)

### **Step 2: Join Using URL**
1. **Open Browser 2** to `http://localhost:3000/?join=ihaqhfsio`
2. **Click "Demo Mode"** when prompted
3. **The browser should automatically join the lobby**

### **Step 3: Game Should Start!**
Once both players are in the same lobby:
- ✅ Both browsers will show "2 Players Online"
- ✅ Game will start automatically
- ✅ Math questions will appear

## 🔍 **What Was Fixed**
- **Race condition**: WebSocket was creating new lobby before join could execute
- **Join timing**: Now waits for WebSocket connection before attempting join
- **Mode detection**: Prevents automatic lobby creation when in join mode

## 🎯 **Expected Console Logs**
When it works, you should see:
```
URL join parameter detected: ihaqhfsio
WebSocket connected
In join mode, waiting for join attempt
WebSocket connected, attempting to join lobby: ihaqhfsio
```

## 🚀 **Quick Test**
1. **Create lobby in Browser 1**
2. **Use the share URL in Browser 2**
3. **Game should start automatically!**

The URL join should now work perfectly!
