# Testing Multiple Browsers - Wallet Loading Fix

## Problem Fixed
The "Loading wallet..." issue when testing with multiple browsers has been resolved. The app now:

1. **Has a timeout mechanism**: Instead of waiting indefinitely for `window.ethereum`, it now waits a maximum of 5 seconds
2. **Falls back gracefully**: If no wallet is detected after the timeout, it proceeds anyway (perfect for demo mode)
3. **Better debug logging**: Console logs help identify what's happening during the loading process

## How to Test

### Method 1: Two Different Browsers
1. Open Chrome and go to `http://localhost:3000`
2. Open Firefox and go to `http://localhost:3000`
3. Both should load properly now (no more infinite "Loading wallet...")

### Method 2: Same Browser, Different Profiles
1. Open Chrome normally and go to `http://localhost:3000`
2. Open Chrome Incognito mode and go to `http://localhost:3000`
3. Both should work

### Method 3: Demo Mode (Recommended for Testing)
1. In any browser, click "Demo Mode (No Wallet Required)"
2. This generates a unique demo address for testing
3. Perfect for testing with multiple browser instances

## What to Look For

### Console Logs
Open browser dev tools (F12) and check the console for these messages:
- `"Wallet detected, proceeding with app"` - Wallet found quickly
- `"No wallet detected after timeout, proceeding anyway (demo mode available)"` - No wallet, but app continues
- `"HomeContent: Showing wallet connection screen"` - Normal wallet connection flow
- `"HomeContent: Entering demo mode with address: 0xDemo..."` - Demo mode activated

### Expected Behavior
- **With wallet**: Should show wallet connection screen or connect automatically
- **Without wallet**: Should show wallet connection screen with "Demo Mode" button
- **Demo mode**: Should work in any browser without wallet dependency

## Testing the Game
1. Open two browser windows/tabs
2. In both, click "Demo Mode (No Wallet Required)"
3. One creates a lobby, the other joins via the lobby URL
4. Test the 1v1 math duel functionality

## Troubleshooting
If you still see "Loading wallet..." for more than 5 seconds:
1. Check browser console for error messages
2. Try refreshing the page
3. Clear browser cache if needed
4. Use demo mode as a fallback

The fix ensures the app works in all scenarios while maintaining the wallet functionality when available.
